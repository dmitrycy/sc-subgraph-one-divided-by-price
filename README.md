# Subgraph One Divided By Price Study for Sierra Chart

This is a study which can take in another study as an input and invert its values. 

Primary use case: it can take EURGBP (added via Add Additional Symbol Study) closing prices and create a line with GBPEUR closing prices, which can then be overlaid on the main price graph.

This study cannot create candlesticks like the original 1 Divided by Price study can.
